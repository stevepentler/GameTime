## Objective
The hurrican has passed, but *"people still need them shrimps for shrimp cocktails and barbecues and all."* And since you're the only boat left standing, help Forrest and Lieutenant Dan create Bubba Gump's Shrimp. 

## How to Play
#### Guide the Jenny and drop nets on the shrimp to collect points.
1. Press enter to begin each round.
2. Move *Jenny* across the ocean using the left and right arrows.
3. Spacebar drops nets that can trap multiple shrimp.
4. Capture enough shrimp to pass each round!

#### Pro Tips
1. Turn up the volume! The shrimp's movement is based on the amplitude of the song.
2. The most valuable shrimp feed at the bottom. 
3. If you win round 3, Bubba will tell you all his recipes!

## Features/Challenges
- Integrating p5 processing (p5, p5.sound, p5.dom). See this [gist](https://gist.github.com/stevepentler/99d89ad4ef79b9fae0dd628961e7bbd7) to get a better understanding of our implementation.
- Finishing our first JavaScript project!
